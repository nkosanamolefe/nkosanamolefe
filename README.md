I am a data enthusiast with a passion for leveraging data and AI to solve complex business challenges across industries. With over three years of experience combining project management and analytics, I bring a unique blend of organizational leadership and technical expertise to every project. My recent certification as an [Data Analyst Associate](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DAA0018224841110) has strengthened my ability to extract insights, tell compelling stories with data, and deliver actionable solutions.

What excites me most about my work is the opportunity to uncover hidden patterns, optimize processes, and drive impactful decision-making using data.

My goal is to continually expand my technical expertise while contributing to projects that make a meaningful difference for businesses and communities.
